/*
 * Send Manage command to the device
 *
 * A manage command is a message that consists of N transactions.  The set
 * of transactions consititues a single operation.  In most cases, a manage
 * command is a request for the device to do something.  The entire command
 * must be encoded into a single message.
 *
 * The command will be encoded into the wire format, and sent to the device.
 * the process will then be blocked until the device responds to the message
 * or a timeout is reached.  If a response is successfully received, it will
 * be encoded into the provided message structure.
 *
 * The return value is 0 for success, or a standard error code.  Some of the
 * possible errors:
 *
 * EINTR     - Kernel waiting was interrupted (IE received a signal for user)
 * ETIMEDOUT - Timeout for response from device expired
 * EINVAL    - Invalid message
 * ENOSPC    - Ran out of space to encode the message into the wire protocol
 * ENOMEM    - Unable to obtain memory while processing message
 * EFAULT    - Error in accessing memory from user

/*
 * Memory alloc/free
 *
 * Allows user to request buffers to send/receive data to/from the device
 * via a DMA Bridge channel.  An allocated buffer may then be mmap'd to be
 * accessed.  Buffers are tied to a specific dbc.  It is expected that the
 * user will request a pool of buffers, and reuse the buffers as necessary
 * to send/receive multiple sets of data with the device over time.
 *
 * The handle to the allocated buffer will be returned in the struct upon
 * success.  A buffer to be freed cannot be accessed after the ioctl is called.
 *
 * A request for a 0 size buffer is valid.  This signals that the DMA
 * operation to/from the device does not transfer data, but does perform
 * other tasks (ring doorbell, etc).  A handle from a zero size request cannot
 * be mmap()'d.
 *
 * The return value is 0 for success, or a standard error code.  Some of the
 * possible errors:
 *
 * EINTR  - Kernel waiting was interrupted (IE received a signal for user)
 * ENOMEM - Unable to obtain memory while processing request
 * EPERM  - Invalid permissions to access resource
 * EINVAL - Invalid request
 * EFAULT - Error in accessing memory from user
 * ENODEV - Resource does not exist

 * Execute DMA Bridge transaction
 *
 * Allows user to execute a DMA Bridge transaction using a previously allocated

 * indicates the transaction is queued with the hardware, not that it is
 * complete.  The user must ensure that the transaction is complete before
 * reusing the memory resource.  It is invalid to attempt to execute multiple
 * transactions concurrently which use the same memory resource in the same
 * direction.
